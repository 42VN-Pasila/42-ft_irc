## 🎯 Overview

ft_irc transforms network programming theory into a real IRC server. Built with modern C++ and enterprise architecture, supporting concurrent clients, comprehensive channel management, and full IRC protocol compliance.

## 🌟 Core Features

### 🔐 **Authentication & User Management**
* PASS/NICK/USER registration flow with state machine
* Password-protected server access with validation
* Nickname uniqueness enforcement
* Session management with proper cleanup

### 💬 **Channel & Messaging System**
* CREATE/JOIN/PART channels with #channel syntax
* PRIVMSG to channels and users (multi-target support)
* TOPIC management with operator restrictions
* INVITE system for exclusive access
* KICK functionality with optional reasons

### ⚙️ **Advanced Channel Modes**
* **+i** (invite-only): Restrict to invited users
* **+t** (topic restriction): Operators-only topic changes
* **+k** (password): Channel password protection
* **+o** (operator): Grant/revoke operator privileges
* **+l** (user limit): Maximum channel capacity

### 🌐 **Enterprise Network Architecture**
* Poll-based I/O for scalable concurrent connections
* Non-blocking socket operations
* Signal handling (SIGINT/SIGQUIT) for graceful shutdown
* Advanced buffer management with proper IRC \r\n parsing
* Comprehensive error handling (38+ IRC error codes)

## 🔍 Technical Implementation

### **Network Layer**
```cpp
Server::pollAndAccept() → poll() monitoring → accept() connections
recv() → parse IRC messages → send() responses with \r\n
Signal handling → graceful shutdown procedures
```
### **Command Processing**
```cpp
parseCommand() → parseSign() (auth) | execCommand() (IRC commands)
Function pointer dispatch → parseJoin/parsePart/parsePrivmsg/parseMode
Multi-target parsing → comma-separated lists support
```
### **Architecture Design**
```cpp
Server → manages Channels and Clients
Channel → member lists + operator privileges + modes
Client → authentication state + socket + session data
Notifyer → centralized messaging and error reporting
```
### **Memory Management**
```cpp
~Server() → cleanup channels → remove references → delete clients
removeClient() → part all channels → notify users → cleanup resources
RAII pattern → exception-safe resource management
```
### 🧪 **IRC Client Compatibility**
```bash
nc localhost 6667          # Basic testing
irssi, WeeChat, HexChat     # Professional clients
./python_tester.py          # Automated testing
```
### 🚀 **Usage**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/42VN-Pasila/42-ft_irc.git

# Compile
make

# Start server
./ircserv <port> <password>
./ircserv 6667 mypass

# Connect & use
nc localhost 6667
PASS mypass
NICK username
USER username 0 * :Real Name
JOIN #general
PRIVMSG #general :Hello World!
MODE #general +i
KICK #general user :reason
QUIT :Goodbye
```

### 📊 **Project Metrics**
