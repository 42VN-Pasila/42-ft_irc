5. MODE
/mode #channel +abcd
is parsed character by character. Each letter must correspond to a valid channel mode.
If a letter is not recognized by the server, it is simply ignored (or sometimes generates 472 ERR_UNKNOWNMODE)
(Minh chi handle +i, cac mode khac co kem parameter -> khong can handle them)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TESTING +i -i mode:
/mode #channel +i
/mode #channel -i

Channel operator sets invite-only -> successful ✅

Outsider tries to join while +i is active -> successful ✅

Channel operator removes invite-only -> successful ✅

Operator invites someone -> successful ✅

+i removed, outsider joins -> successful ✅

These cases succeed. But the message only shows in server. Should it appear in user's window? ✅👉

mode #channel +iiiiiiiiiii -> invite-only mode set (correct behavior) -> successful ✅👉

mode #channel +isdmmbgdsb -> invite-only mode set (correct behavior) -> successful ✅👉

mode #channel -iiii -> invite-only mode disable (correct behavior) -> successful ✅👉

Non-operator tries to set +i. In user's window should show: #<channel> You're not channel operator.
Server shows error message but not user's window. -> successful ✅👉



⚠️ 
channel was set to invite-only, everybody left, nobody can join because it still exists + set to invite-only.
A channel ceases to exist the moment the last user leaves. At that moment, all modes, topic, invite lists -> are destroyed too.
If later somebody else does /join #op, it’s treated as a brand new channel with no modes, no topic, nothing -> failed


⚠️
/name #<channel> not showing status:
Irssi: #3: Total of 2 nicks [1 ops, 0 halfops, 0 voices, 1 normal]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TESSTING +k -k mode:
/mode #channel +k password (set password)
/mode #channel -k          (remove password)


These cases succeed. But the message only shows in server. Should it appear in user's window? ✅👉
mode #channel +k secret -> Non-operator tries to set key -> successful ✅👉
mode #channel +k -> set key without argument -> successful ✅👉

/mode #channel +k pass1 pass2 -> accepts space(s) in between -> should it? ⚠️

mode #channel -k dummy -> Remove key but give parameter -> failed ⚠️ (Parameter is ignored; correct behavior is just remove the key.)



6. INVITE
INVITE nickname #channel

These cases succeed. But the message only shows in server. Should it appear in user's window? ✅👉

Invite when already in channel -> successful ✅👉

/invite bob #doesnotexist -> invite to non-existent channel -> successful ✅👉
