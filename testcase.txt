1. Test channel required password
Case 1:
Issue: space after comma when input multiple channels to JOIN doesn't trigger error.
`
JOIN #cat, #dog
[SERVER] : [CHANNEL cat] :[CHANNEL cat]: Welcome 5 to the channel
`

Case 2:
Issue: JOIN #channel password when the channel doesn't require password -> works normally. Should it trigger an error?

Case 3:
Issue: PRIVMSG to:
    - another client doesn't show sender, only the message.
    - a channel: shows from which channel the message is from, but not the sender.

Case 4:
Issue: password contains comma ','. When a client try to join multiple channels that requires password -> correct password (that contains comma(s) is considered invalid).

Case 5:
Issue(?!) when user join a channel, the lastest topic shows as a prompt.

Case 6:
Issue: multiple clients can have identical nicknames. When send PRIVMSG nickname :Private message, currently the newest client got the message.
And the sender got: [SERVER] :442: [4]  :User is not on that channel
